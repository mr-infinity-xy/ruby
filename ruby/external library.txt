Require
The require method allows we to load a library and prevents it from being loaded more than once. The require method will return false if we try to load the same library after the first time. The require method only needs to be used if library we are loading is defined in a separate file, which is usually the case. So it keeps track of whether that library was already loaded or not. We also don’t need to specify the “.rb” extension of the library file name.
eg)
Mod.rb file
module A
def A.print_string str
  puts str
end
end

RequireModule.rb file
$LOAD_PATH << "."
require "Mod"
puts A.print_string "Hi ruby"
